                    BOM is for browser environments. Other evironments like Node.js, won't have a window object. They will 
                    have a global object though.

                    <strong>window.location -></strong> returns information about the URL. You could use the href property to

                       -> the .go() method is used to go to specific pages. 0 is the current page, 1 is 1 page forward. -1 is 1

                    <strong>window.screen -> </strong>used to get information about the screen. You can get the height and width using 
                    the height and width properties. This is most useful for mobile devices.

                    window.setTimeout() and window.setInterval() accepts a callback function as it's first paramater and a time in milliseconds 
                    as the second. It will call the callback function after the time passed. For setTimeout(), it will call it once. For setInverval() 
                    it will call it repeatedly. To get it to stop, use window.clearInterval().

                    <strong>data- -></strong> These attributes are custom attributes that are ignored by the browser and 
                    used to embed data into a web page. Their purpose is to be used by JavaScript.

                <p class="notes-p">
                    To access data attributes in JavaScript, you can use the dataset object. An example of this will look like 
                    (superman.dataset.powers). The data- prefix is dropped. Plus, any hyphens used are replaced with camel-case 
                    notation. You could also use .getAttribute() for older browsers.

                    Local storage methods include: getItem() for getting an item, setItem() for adding an item, removeItem() for 
                    deleting an item, and clear() to remove everything in local storage

                    The Web Workers API can be used to allow processes to be run in the background. To start, use the new Worker() 
                    constructor function. The parameters include a separate js file to load asynchronously. This doesn't work in 
                    Chrome, however.

                    video and audio tags were introduced in HTML5. This allows you to add video and audio to your page. If you add the controls
