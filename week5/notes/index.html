                <p class="notes-p">Stack Trace -> A sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
                    This can be produced with an exception error. It will work backwards from the point that the error occurred.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Warnings happen when there is an error that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. The program will 
                    still contiue to run after the warning which can be problematic.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Strict mode considers coding practices that were previously though of as 'poor style' as erros. This means 
                    that using strict mode will make you code better and not sloppy.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">The most basic form of debugging with a browser was to use alerts as breakpoints. You just have to create alerts 
                    at different points in your code that return values. However, it is no longer recomended. Now, you could use the Console object. 
                    The console.log() method is useful for logging the variable at different stages. Or you could set breakpoints with the debugger 
                    keyword. This way will actually pause the execution of the other code until play is hit. Just don't forget to remove it when you 
                    finish.
