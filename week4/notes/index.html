                <p class="notes-p">The placeholder attribute is useful for having text in an input field when
                    the input is out of focus. It also will not have text when the input field does have focus. 
                    However, this text is not a value and will not be submitted.

                <p class="notes-p">Encapsulation is when the functionality of an object's methods is kept inside
                    the object. Then you make the methods available to use the functionality.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p"> Polymorphism is when the same process can be used for 
                    different objects. This means objects can share methods. However, they can overide these shared
                    methods with different implementations.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Inheritance is when an object takes another that already exists and gains the methods
                    and properties from that object. They also havve the ability to create new methods and properties.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Constructor Function -> a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. 
                    This is another way to create an object. However, it is preferable to use the class declarations even if 
                    they are implementated the same way. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">You can use the constructor property to make a copy of an object if you don't know what the 
                    original constructor is.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Static Methods -> methods using the static keyword. They are called by the class directly, 
                    not instances of the class. So instances of the class don't have this static method.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">To add a new method to the original class declaration (the prototype), you can use the prototype 
                    property. This property returns an object. The prototype is also an object and that means that we can use the 
                    prototype property to add new properties to the prototype object. You can also do the same thing with methods. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">You cannot reassign prototypes when declared with class declarations. However, this is possible 
                    to do with constructor functions.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Don't use arrays or objects as default values in a prototype. Any changes to these values will 
                    be reflected in all instances of an object. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Sub-class (aka child class) -> a class that inherits from another class. You can do this by using 
                    the keyword extends in the sub-class declaration. Then you use the word super() to get methods from the parent 
                    class.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">If you want to add a property beside value, you will need to use the Object.defineProperty(object, 
                    attributeToSet, {attributeValues}) method.
