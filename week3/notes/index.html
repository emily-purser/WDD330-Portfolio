                <p class="notes-p">Methods are functions that are properties of objects.</p>
                <p class="notes-p">The keyword 'this' is used to access the object before the 
                dot. It is also evaluated at runtime. This means that we can reuse the same function
                for different objects. It is also unbound. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Arrow functions don't have a 'this'.</p>

                <h1 class="notes-h1">JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, Chapter 5: Objects</h1>
                <p class="notes-p">The 'in' operator is used to see if an object has a method.</p>
                <p class="notes-p">For in loops can be used to see all the methods an object has. 
                    You can use the 'hasOwnProperty()' inside the for in loop to get only the methods 
                    the object has not the ones that it inherits. You can also access the methods of an
                    object by using 'Object.entries()'. This, however, returns an array. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">To delete methods for an object, use the 'delete' keyword. For example, 
                    delete superman.fly.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Objects can be nested. To access them, use the property names in order.
                    For example, jla.superman.name.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Since objects are assigned by reference, if you try to make a clone of 
                    one object, it will not work. The clone will just point to the original object. If you make
                    changes to the original, it will change the clone as well.
                </p>

                <h1 class="notes-h1">JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, Chapter 6: Document Object Model</h1>
                <p class="notes-p">You can use the '.querySelectorAll()'' to get all HTML elements
                    with a specific CSS Selector. If you just want one, you can use '.querySelector()'.
                    You can even use other references instead of document.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">If you want to change the class name of an element, you need to use the 
                    keyword className instead of class. However, this will override all the classes for that
                    element. To avoid this, use classList instead. It has methods that make manipulating the
                    class list easier. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">To add an element using JavaScript, use the 'createElement' document 
                    method. This creates an empty element. You will need to use 'createTextNode' to 
                    add text to the element. To link the two together, you need to use '.appendChild()'.
                    Or you can create the element and use the 'textContent' property to add text to the 
                    element.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">'insertBefore()' lets you insert a new element above an existing element.
                    There is no insertAfter method.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">To remove an element from the DOM, use the parentNode.removeChild(nodeToBeRemoved) 
                    method. This returns a reference to the node removed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter-div">
                <h1 class="notes-h1">JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, Chapter 7: Events</h1>
                <p class="notes-p">When using an Event Listener and referencing a named function, 
                    you don't include the parenthesis. If you do, the function will be called when you 
                    set the event listener instead of when the event happens. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">You can prevent a default event from happening to an element. To do 
                    this, use the preventDefault() event method.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">Event propagation is the order taht the events fire on each element. 
                    With bubbling, it starts at the element clicked first then goes up to the root element.
                    With capturing, however, it starts at the roo element and then goes down to the clicked
                    element.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">The default is bubbling. To switch to capturing, set the third parameter
                    of addEventListener to true. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">To stop both from happening, use the event.stopPropagation() method to 
                    stop bubbling and set the third parameter of addEventListener to true to false to stop 
                    capturing.
