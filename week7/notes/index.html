                <p class="notes-p">Functions are first-class objects which means that they can have properties and methods.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">call() -> a method for all functions that can be used to set the value of this inside a function to 
                    an object that is provided as the first argument. The first parameter is the value for this and the second is for any 
                    other parameters the function itself needs. You can also use call() on a function that doesn't refer to this. You just 
                    need to put null as the first parameter.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">You can add your own properties to your functions just like you can to other objects {square.description}.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p"><strong>Memoziation -></strong>result caching. So when you have a function that takes a lot to compute the 
                    answer, you can use this to get the answer from the cache property instead. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p"><strong>Immediately Invoked Function Express (IFFE) -></strong> An anonymous function taht is invoked as soon 
                    as it's defined. You can do this by placing the declaration in parenthesis and then some empty parenthesis directly after the 
                    declaration. This can be great for function you need to be initailized, like a welcome message when the page loads.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">To make a function available to call, define, and rewrite itself, you need to add an anonymous function inside the 
                    function and assign it to a variable that has the same name as the function. Anything inside that anonymous function will rewrite 
                    what was in the original starting on the seconde time it is called. However, if this entire function is assigned to another variable, 
                    it will keep the original definition.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p"><strong>Recursive Functions -></strong> a function that invokes itself until a condition is met.
                </p>

                <p class="notes-p">
                    The Fetch API uses promises. It has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource to be fetched.
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p"><strong>Blog() -></strong> used to read a file of raw data (like an image or a spreadsheet) 
                    and returns a promise witha a blob object. 
                </p>
                <p class="notes-p">FormData() is very useful for uploading files. Before this, it was so hard and would require the 
                    use of third-party browser plugins. Now, this interface will do all the hard work of creating the necessary 
                    settings and etc. for us.
