                    3 reasons to validate forms: we want the right data in the right 
                    format; it protects user data; it also protects us.

                    In order to control the look and feel of native error messages or deal 
                    with legacy browsers that don't support HTML's built-in form validation, 
                    you have to use JavaScript.

                <p class="notes-p">
                    You can create a new request object and pass that into fetch request. It takes 
                    the same parameters.

                <p class="notes-p">
                    A request can only be used once, to use it again, you will have to clone it or 
                    pass the request to the new request object. Just make sure that the request or 
                    response hasn't been read or the request will fail.
